<?php
$variable = new mysqli('127.0.0.1', 'your_user', 'your_pass', 'database_name');
// Oh no! A connect_errno exists so the connection attempt failed!
if ($mysqli->connect_errno)
		{
    // The connection failed. What do you want to do?
    // You could contact yourself (email?), log the error, show a nice page, etc.
    // You do not want to reveal sensitive information
    // Let's try this:
    echo "Sorry, this website is experiencing problems.";
		exit;
		}
// Perform an SQL query
$query_name = "SELECT column1, column2, column3 from tablename where condition == true";
if (!$result = $mysqli->query($query_name))
	{
    // Oh no! The query failed.
    echo "Sorry, the website is experiencing problems.";
		exit;
	}
	//Some other stuff tbh
?>
