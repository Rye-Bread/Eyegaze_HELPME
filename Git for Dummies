I wanna make sure I'm up to date:
1) First make sure you're in the right directory.
	cd ~/environment/BrewPal
2) Now use the appropriate command.
	git pull

I wanna update the github:
A) I added files.
	git add filenamehere filenamehere filenamehere
	git commit
B) I changed files but didn't add any.
	git commit -a -m "my message here. This can be blank, but keep the quotes"
C) I did both
	git add filenamehere filenamehere filenamehere
	git commit -a -m  "my message here. This can be blank, but keep the quotes"
Now,
	git push
You'll be asked for your username and password.
