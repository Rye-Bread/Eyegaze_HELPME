('Center Eye and Focus Camera', 'The display of the full camera image provides information about whether the subject<sup>\'</sup>s eye is within the camera<sup>\'</sup>s field of view and is used to position the user for calibration. Until the eye is clearly visible in the image, there will be no magnified image of the eye on the left. The camera angle and the focus range must be adjusted so a clear image of the user<sup>\'</sup>s eye appears. To center the eye and focus the camera, the focus range indicator and the camera must be adjusted. Please adhere to the following instructions to focus the range indicator and adjust the camera:', '<h4>Focus Range Indicator</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the magnified eye display shows the user\'s eye, the eye is being tracked. You will see a bright tracking indicator dot in the center of the pupil and a dark tracking indicator dot in the center of the glint spot (corneal reflection). Look for these tracking indicators during the process of positioning the user. The user is in good position when the image of the eye is centered and in clear focus, and the tracking indicator dots are present.\r\n\r\nA focus indicator is displayed between the two eye images. The focus indicator is a dot that moves up or down showing whether the subject is too close or too far from the camera. If the focus indicator is centered on the reference tick mark, the eye is in perfect focus. If the focus indicator reaches either end of the scale, the eye is approximately 0.75 inch (2 cm) out of focus. As an additional indicator, the video images of the eye turn red or green if the eye moves significantly out of focus. Green indicates that the subject should move (go) forward to restore good focus, and red indicates that he should move backward (retreat).\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h4>Adjust the Camera</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPosition the Eyegaze screen a comfortable distance from the user, typically around 20-26 inches away from the screen, with the top of the screen at eye level or lower. Adjust the camera angle to point the camera toward the user<sup>\'</sup>s eye. Use the full camera image (image to the right) to help locate the eye as you adjust the camera<sup>\'</sup>s focus and angle. Adjust the camera focus by rotating the focus ring until the image is clear. It may be necessary to re-adjust the camera angle in order to get a clear image of the eye. Note: It is usually easier for the user to move his eyes around the screen when it is not too close. \r\n</p>\r\n<div id=hidelink>\r\n<a href=\"topics.php?Title=Interference%20Issue\" accesskey=\"l\">topics</a>\r\n</div>\r\n', 1, 'focus range.png', NULL, NULL),
